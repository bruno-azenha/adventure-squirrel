Hello everybody!

Today Andrea gave us her delightful skeleton of how our  story creation mode will work.

Story files are pickle files that hold the information about a previously generated games. When executing Adventure Squirrel, one can pass a Story File as a parameter to play that particular game.

What are our objectives with the story Creator:

The Writer will be able to create, edit and delete objects in his adventure world
When creating an object, the writer is first prompted with all the required information
The writer is prompted with a list of optional additions. (Add Connection, Add Action ”with associated verb”, add item, for example)
We talked a bunch about how there can be two different situations of objects creation. The first one is when the Writer creates the objects beforehand and then links them together. The second one is when the writer creates objects during the process of another object's creation.
The Writer MUST be able to save his story - Automatic outputting on pickle files while he edits.

What do we need to do for this week:
	
Room creation capabilities all work - Andrea
			must always create room name and description before we can create another room
Item creation capabilities - Bruno
Base actions all items should have (ex. listen, hear, examine,look at, etc.) -
Room connection capabilities - Andrea
Item placement in rooms

create the actual engine: player class, inventory, run the game, etc.
			mode 1: read the pickle file
			mode 2: read info from the user

Summary:
			Bruno - Items
			Andrea - Rooms
			Wenjie - Initial skeleton for actual playtime - Create Player, inventory and game classes...

Next meeting:
November 3, 9am, SIPA Library.
