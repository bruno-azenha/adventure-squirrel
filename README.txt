Game graphics are evolving at an alarming rate, we have already achieved
a level of photorealism that pushes computer hardware advanced further
and further. In the midst of all this, it is often forgotten how even
with simple strings of characters we can have an amazingly immersive
game experience. Our purpose is to chart our own path through the joy of
creating a text based adventure game engine that is both flexible and
simple with the help of Python as a high level language.
